## About
*FOV* is an application to help you get an overview of your finances, by combining data from different platforms. Currently, the main goal is to implement support for [SpareBank 1](https://www.sparebank1.no), [Nordnet](https://www.nordnet.no/no) and [Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/) using their APIs.

## Installation
You can download the application from the [releases](https://github.com/jonassterud/fov/releases) section here on GitHub.

## Configuration
When you first run the program, you are asked what APIs you want to enable and then you are asked to provide the different API keys, etc. The data is then stored in an encrypted file called `secret.toml`.
